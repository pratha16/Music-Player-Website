            Music has always been a means of entertaining people even from the earliest ages of the civilization. Historically it was
            <br>produced by musicians and only available during life concerts.<br> The technological evolution made it possible to save the music on vinyl plates, later electromagnetic charged stripes, CDs until the technology brought us to saving tracks digitally.<br>When dealing with a huge collection of tracks, people encounter management problems they did not have before. So they have to develop new ways of using the music collection for their entertainment.<br> Playlists are a good approach for saving successions of tracks that one likes.<br>The most dominant problem of existing playlist generation mechanisms is, however, their lack of flexibility: new tracks are not automatically added, they dont adapt to the users current mood etc.
